        . When we bought our home it was imperiative to be close to water so we decided on a raised camp on the bayou. Its been great, I have a small flat boat that I take out often. We fish, wake board, swim and, shine bull frogs. In my early years, I was a bit rambunchous. wrestling alligators, riding bulls, wrangling wild hogs. Nothing seemed to slow my thrill seeking untill I realized I need money. Over the last 10 years or so, I've had my nose to the grindstone working insane hours in oil refineries around the country. Driven by desire to learn and of course $$, month by month I worked my way up the ladder; boilermaker, pipe fitter, fabricator, supervisor, and finally weld inspector. Between the strees of 84 hr work weeks and the thrill of travel Its been a hell of a ride. But, as things change with time so have my priorities and as I enter my 30's I know it's time to find aim toward a more structured sustainable career. Im just trying to improve my family's life with a little direction and a whole lotta hard work  ";
